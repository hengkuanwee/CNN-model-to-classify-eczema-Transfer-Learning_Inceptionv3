# CNN-model-to-classify-eczema-Transfer-Learning_Inceptionv3
I have dermatitis (i.e. eczema) since childhood and is hence really interested in building a model in which users will be able to classify the different types of dermatitis currently known to us.  From the National Skin centre webpage (link text ) I notice that there are 5 different categories of eczema:  Seborrhoeic Dermatitis Discoid Eczema Asteatotic Venous Eczema Contact Dermatitis (I decided not to classify this as the symptoms depends largely on the cause, the irritant or allergen that came in contact with the skin) Therefore, I will try to create a dermatitis classifier model using transfer learning with Inceptionv3, hopefully it works!!!
